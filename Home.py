Welcome to the Hackathon! This event brings together computational scientists, immunologists, and clinical researchers to explore the formation and functionality of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLSs) in the tumor microenvironment. Using cutting-edge tools like MaxFuse, participants will integrate RNA and protein data to uncover novel insights.

st.markdown("### Goals")
st.write("""
- Integrate multi-modal datasets (RNA and protein) to study TLS formation and their role in immune-tumor interactions.
- Analyze TLS-related gene signatures (e.g., CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21) to identify immune biomarkers.
- Encourage collaboration to innovate solutions for immunotherapy challenges.
